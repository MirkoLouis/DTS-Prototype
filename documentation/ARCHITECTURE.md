# DTS System Architecture & Core Logic

## Summary
A comprehensive technical deep-dive into the Document Tracking System (DTS) designed for the **DepEd Division of Iligan City**. This document details the underlying technologies, the end-to-end document lifecycle, the sophisticated cryptographic "Trust Builder" (hashing and Ed25519 signatures), and the AI-driven route prediction engine. It is intended for developers, system architects, and technical stakeholders.

## 1. Technology Stack & Libraries

The DTS is built on a modern, high-performance stack optimized for security and scalability.

### Core Technologies
- **PHP 8.3 & Laravel 12**: The primary backend engine. PHP 8.3 provides high-speed execution and native support for the `sodium` cryptographic library. Laravel 12 offers a robust framework for role-based access control, background jobs, and database management.
- **MySQL 8.0**: Chosen for its support of **JSON** data types (used for flexible metadata) and **Window Functions** (used for high-speed, disk-level analytics calculations).
- **Tailwind CSS 4 & Bootstrap 5 (CSS-only)**: A hybrid frontend approach. Tailwind CSS 4 provides modern, utility-first styling for interactive components, while Bootstrap 5 ensures a consistent grid layout.
- **Node.js & Vite**: The asset pipeline that bundles frontend code for maximum performance (HMR).

### Key Libraries
- **Sodium (Ed25519)**: A world-class library for digital signatures and encryption. Used for non-repudiation in document actions.
- **html5-qrcode**: Enables high-speed QR code scanning via mobile cameras or webcams, essential for physical document handoffs.
- **Chart.js**: Powers the real-time "Bottleneck Detector" and throughput analytics dashboards.
- **dompdf & iio/libmergepdf**: Used for generating and merging massive PDF reports (10,000+ records) efficiently using memory-safe chunking.

## 2. Document Lifecycle: The Digital Journey

The DTS digitizes the physical document workflow while maintaining a strict chain of custody.

| Step | Action | Responsible Code / Function | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | **Submission** | `GuestController@store` | A guest submits a document. A **"Genesis Log"** is created with a unique tracking code. |
| **2** | **Intake** | `DocumentController@finalize` | A Records Officer reviews the document and finalizes the route (assisted by AI). The first signature is generated. |
| **3** | **Receive** | `DocumentController@scan` | A department scans the QR code to "Receive" the physical document. Status changes to **processing**. |
| **4** | **Complete** | `TaskController@complete` | A department finishes their work. The user signs the action, and the document advances to the next step. |
| **5** | **Return** | `ReturnRequestController@store` | (Optional) A department can inject a "Return Request" to send the document back for corrections. |
| **6** | **Release** | `ReleasingController@complete` | The Records Officer performs the final release. The document is marked **completed** and signed. |

## 3. The Trust Builder: Cryptographic Ledger

The **Trust Builder** is the core security layer that ensures no document action can be tampered with or denied.

### State Hashing (`calculateStateHash`)
Every time a log is created, the system takes a "snapshot" of the document's metadata (Title, Submitter, Department, etc.).
- **Logic**: It concatenates these fields with delimiters (`|`) and generates a **SHA-256** hash.
- **Purpose**: If anyone modifies a document's title directly in the database, the State Hash won't match the historical record, triggering an **Auto-Freeze**.

### Hash Chaining (`boot` method)
Each log entry is a "block" in a chain.
- **Logic**: A log's hash is calculated using the `previous_hash` + current metadata + `document_state_hash` + user's `signature`.
- **Purpose**: This creates an immutable ledger where changing one old log breaks the entire chain downstream.

### Digital Signatures (Ed25519)
The DTS uses **Ed25519** for absolute non-repudiation.
1.  **Key Storage**: Every user has a Public/Private key pair. The Private Key is encrypted using **Sodium Secretbox** with a key derived from the user's **Security PIN**.
2.  **Signing**: When a user performs an action, the system decrypts the Private Key (using the PIN) and signs a bundle containing the `Action Text` and the `State Hash`.
3.  **Departmental Identity**: While signatures are user-specific, they are cryptographically bonded to the user's unit, ensuring that "Unit Actions" are always verifiable back to a specific individual.

## 4. AI Route Prediction & Machine Learning

The DTS includes a smart routing assistant that suggests the most likely department for a document based on its context.

### TF-IDF Prediction Engine
The AI uses a **Weighted TF-IDF** (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.
- **Scoring**: `Score = (Frequency of word in Title) * (Learned Weight) * (Rarity of word in system)`.
- **Why it works**: Common words like "The" are ignored. Rare, impactful words like "Salary" or "Appointment" have higher scores, correctly pointing the document to "Payroll" or "Personnel."

### Machine Learning Loop (`UpdateKeywordWeights`)
The system "learns" from human expertise.
1.  **Correction**: If a Records Officer changes an AI-suggested route, the system notices the discrepancy.
2.  **Learning Job**: A background job (`UpdateKeywordWeights`) is dispatched to analyze the document's context and increment the weights of keywords for the *actual* department chosen.
3.  **Result**: The more the system is used and "corrected," the more accurate its future suggestions become.

## 5. Operational Infrastructure & Analytics Logic

### Nomadic SSL Management (mDNS)
To support mobile QR scanning, the system uses **mDNS** (`.local`). This allows a phone and a server to communicate via a human-readable name without fixed IP addresses. A **Secure Proxy** (Port 3051) wraps the standard server (Port 3050) in an HTTPS "Cloak," providing the secure context required for camera access.

### Analytics: The "RAM Trap" Guard
DTS analytics dashboards use **MySQL 8.0 Window Functions** (`LAG()`, `OVER()`). 
- **The Problem**: Standard apps load 100,000 rows into RAM to calculate math, crashing the server.
- **The DTS Solution**: The database performs the math on disk before sending only the final totals to the dashboard. This ensures the system remains fast even with 1,000,000 records.
