All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2026-07-27 16:59

**Version:** 1.23.1-Alpha+202607271659

### Fixed
- Fixed document back routing and browser history state corruption across [`pjax-router.js`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/public/js/pjax-router.js), [`show-document.php`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/general/show-document.php), [`document-hash-chain.php`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/general/document-hash-chain.php), and [`DocumentController.php`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Controllers/DocumentController.php).
- Resolved duplicate `history.pushState()` calls during `popstate` events in [`pjax-router.js`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/public/js/pjax-router.js) that broke `history.back()`.
- Implemented `sessionStorage` origin URL tracking (`dts_doc_origin`) to return users to their exact entry page (including active filter query parameters and table pagination state) when navigating back from document details.

### Added
- N/A

## 2026-07-27 16:46

**Version:** 1.23.0-Release+202607271646

### Fixed
- Fixed document sorting and pagination in `DocumentQueryService.php` by changing default document list ordering to `created_at DESC, id DESC` and introducing a compound cursor format (`created_at_id`) for keyset pagination with backward-compatibility for single ID cursors.
- Updated fast and Node database seeders (`fast-seed.php` and `seed.js`) to strictly preserve chronological monotonicity between generated document IDs and `created_at` timestamps across working days and peak hours.

### Added
- Integrated document state snapshotting (`document_snapshot`) into bulk log insertions inside `fast-seed.php`.
- Added user documentation guide `HASH_VERIFICATION_LAYMAN_GUIDE.md` detailing cryptographic hash chain verification, document state hashing, Ed25519 digital signatures, and genesis integrity.

## 2026-07-27 13:46

**Version:** 1.22.1-Alpha+202607271346

### Fixed
- Added missing **Document Title** (`$document['title']`) field to the Document Information metadata card in [`show-document.php`](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/general/show-document.php).

### Added
- N/A

## 2026-07-27 13:42

**Version:** 1.22.0-Release+202607271342

### Fixed
- N/A

### Added
- Created `CleanupStalePendingDocumentsJob.php` to automatically transition stale pending documents lingering past 3 days without Records Office intake to `declined` status with system-sealed cryptographic log entries.
- Integrated automated 24-hour pending document garbage collection into `console.php` worker scheduler loop.

## 2026-07-27 13:04

**Version:** 1.21.0-Alpha+202607271304

### Fixed
- Replaced increment/placeholder guest emails (`guestX@example.com`, `fastY@test.com`) and 4-digit phone numbers in `fast-seed.php` and `seed.js` with realistic guest profile data.

### Added
- Added `sanitizeForEmail()`, `getRandomDomain()`, and `getRandomPerson()` methods to `WeightedNameGenerator` in `fast-seed.php` and `seed.js`.
- Implemented email handle generation supporting multiple realistic patterns (`firstname_lastname`, `lastname_firstname`, `firstnameLastname`, `lastnameBirthdate`, `firstnamebirthdate`), capping multi-word first names to the first 2 names, realistic birthdate suffixes (e.g., `march1979`, `031979`, `1979`, `79`), common domains (`gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`, `deped.gov.ph`, `outlook.com`, `hotmail.com`), and 11-digit Philippine mobile phone numbers (`09xxxxxxxxx`).

## 2026-07-27 11:14

**Version:** 1.20.0-Alpha+202607271114

### Fixed
- Replaced generic placeholder document titles (`"Fast Seeded Doc X"`, `"Automated Test Document Y"`) in `fast-seed.php` and `seed.js` with realistic DepEd (Department of Education) document titles specific to each document's purpose.

### Added
- Added `working-php/scripts/seeders/titles_data.json` containing 5 domain-appropriate document titles for each of the 23 default database purposes (115 titles total).
- Updated `working-php/scripts/seeders/seed.js` and `working-php/scripts/seeders/fast-seed.php` to fetch purpose names from the database and sample realistic titles matching each document's purpose.

## 2026-07-27 10:43

**Version:** 1.19.0-Alpha+202607271043

### Fixed
- Replaced static placeholder guest names (`"Fast Guest 1"`, `"Seeded Guest 1"`) in `fast-seed.php` and `seed.js` with believable weighted demographic name generation.
- Fixed form input loss on validation failure in `login.php` and `welcome.php`. Valid fields now retain previously entered values across redirects while invalid fields that triggered constraint errors are cleared out and highlighted with high-visibility red borders (`border-red-500 ring-2 ring-red-500/20`) and inline error messages.

### Added
- Added `working-php/scripts/seeders/build-names-json.py` to extract 1,000 forenames and 994 lastnames with population weights from `pop_names.csv` (ISO-8859-1) into a shared UTF-8 dataset `working-php/scripts/seeders/names_data.json`.
- Integrated `WeightedNameGenerator` class into `working-php/scripts/seeders/fast-seed.php` and `working-php/scripts/seeders/seed.js` using roulette-wheel sampling and a multi-word forename distribution (80% single, 18% double, 2% triple first names) to produce believable Filipino names with accented characters intact (*García*, *Rodríguez*, *Fernández*, *López*, *Pérez*, *Sánchez*, *Martínez*, *de León*).
- Added global form flash helpers (`has_error`, `old`, `error_msg`, `field_error_class`, `clear_form_flash`) in `working-php/src/helpers.php` to handle session flash inputs (`$_SESSION['old']`) and field error maps (`$_SESSION['field_errors']`).

## 2026-07-26 15:06

**Version:** 1.18.0-Release+202607261506

### Fixed
- Fixed navigation flow in `working-php/src/Views/layouts/app.php` where clicking the header logo directed authenticated users back to the public guest portal (`/`). Updated the logo link to `/dashboard` so logged-in users return to their role-specific dashboard.
- Standardized top-right header button styling in `working-php/src/Views/layouts/guest.php` using the uniform `table-filters.php` design tokens (`bg-accent-1`, uppercase tracking, focus ring, `h-[38px]`).

### Added
- Added a dedicated "Staff Sign In" (or "Dashboard" when logged in) button to the public guest layout (`guest.php`) next to the theme toggle, providing administrative staff and officers with a direct login path from the guest landing page.
- Added multi-stakeholder pitch documentation (`working-php/documentation/PITCH_AND_VALUE_PROPOSITION.md`) featuring targeted technical value propositions for IT Administrators, Government Decision Makers, Cryptographers/Auditors, Office Workers, and General Citizens.

## 2026-07-26 12:06

**Version:** 1.17.7-Alpha+202607261206

### Fixed
- Fixed an OOM risk in `IntegrityCheckJob.php` where `$mismatchedIds` was an unbounded PHP array appended to on every corrupted log entry, with O(n) `in_array()` deduplication calls that caused O(n²) scan time on large datasets. Replaced with an associative-array hashset (`$mismatchedIdsSet`) for O(1) duplicate detection. Introduced `$mismatchedIdsList` (capped at `MAX_TRACKED_MISMATCHES = 1000`) for safe admin display, and `$mismatchedIdsCount` as a separate accurate total counter so the verified-percentage metric remains correct even when mismatches exceed the cap. Applied the same cap to `$mismatchedDocumentTrackingCodes`.
- Fixed an unbounded disk-growth issue where the `cache/responses/` directory accumulated stale HTML response-cache files indefinitely. Expired files were skipped on serve but never deleted. Added a 4th scheduled task to `console.php`'s internal worker scheduler that runs a garbage collector every hour, purging all `.html` files older than 1 hour (well past the 55s serve TTL).
- Fixed an unbounded disk-growth issue with `storage/logs/navigation.log`, which was appended to on every request with no rotation. The new hourly GC task now archives the log to a timestamped file (e.g., `navigation-2026-07-26-120000.log`) when it exceeds 50 MB.

### Added
- Added `$lastGcTime` timestamp variable and the 4th argument `int &$lastGcTime` to `runScheduledTasks()` in `console.php` to support the new cache GC and log rotation scheduled task.

## 2026-07-26 11:31

**Version:** 1.17.6-Alpha+202607261131

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue in `console.php` where background jobs (like `CreateBackupJob` and `GenerateReportJob`) were processed sequentially in a single-threaded loop, causing bottlenecks during long-running tasks. Refactored the queue worker into a master dispatcher that spawns parallel child processes via `runner.php` up to a configurable concurrency limit (`$maxWorkers = 2`), ensuring true asynchronous background processing.
- Re-ordered columns in the `idx_log_category` composite index in `database.sql` to `(user_id, action_category, document_id, created_at)`. This enables MySQL to perform a "Loose Index Scan" (Skip Scan) on the `GROUP BY document_id` queries inside `DocumentQueryService`, reducing execution time for high-volume users from 1.2s to under 0.4s.

### Added
- Integrated the queue worker directly into the local development server lifecycle. `scripts/dev.php` now seamlessly starts `console.php` in the background (piping output to `storage/logs/worker.log`) and auto-cleans orphaned worker instances upon restart.

## 2026-07-25 20:25

**Version:** 1.17.5-Alpha+202607252025

### Fixed
- Fixed a massive performance bottleneck on `/intake` and `/tasks/completed` pages that caused loading to consistently take ~600ms to over 2 seconds. The underlying SQL query utilized the `ROW_NUMBER() OVER()` window function to filter for the latest log entry per document, which forces MySQL to construct and sort large temporary tables. Refactored the queries in `IntakeController.php` and `DocumentQueryService.php` to use a much more efficient `MAX(created_at) ... GROUP BY document_id` approach. This optimization leverages the covering index and reduces the data query execution time from ~600ms down to 0.05ms, resulting in instantaneous page transitions.

## 2026-07-25 20:10

**Version:** 1.17.4-Alpha+202607252010

### Fixed
- Fixed a major race condition in `pjax-router.js` where page-specific scripts (like `statistics.js` and `system-health.js`) would fail to initialize on the very first PJAX visit to a page, but mysteriously work on the second visit. The router was dispatching the `dts:page-loaded` event synchronously, but the browser was fetching external `<script>` tags asynchronously. This caused the event to fire *before* the script had loaded and registered its listener. Removed all `dts:page-loaded` listeners across all 10 view JS files and replaced them with inline `document.readyState` checks, guaranteeing exactly-once, zero-latency execution on every navigation.

## 2026-07-25 19:41

**Version:** 1.17.3-Alpha+202607251941

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where graphs on `statistics.php` and `system-overview.php` would randomly fail to render after PJAX navigation. Chart.js maintains an internal global registry (`Chart.instances`) of all created charts. When navigating back to these pages, new `<canvas>` elements were generated with identical IDs, but the old chart instances still existed in memory. This caused Chart.js to silently throw "Canvas is already in use" errors. Resolved by iterating through `Chart.instances` and forcefully destroying all charts in `pjax-router.js` immediately before executing the DOM swap.
- Patched a memory and network leak in `statistics.js` where the 60-second `setInterval` data poller was never cleared upon PJAX navigation, causing multiple concurrent polling intervals to stack and spam the server with redundant requests. It is now properly wired to abort alongside the global PJAX controller.

## 2026-07-25 19:23

**Version:** 1.17.2-Alpha+202607251923

### Fixed
- Fixed a visual bug in `pjax-router.js` where the active navigation indicator would sometimes appear grey or duplicate (e.g. both "Tasks" and "Completed" highlighting simultaneously). This happened because the client-side router used a flawed string-matching algorithm (`startsWith`) and failed to perfectly mirror the complex Tailwind class permutations defined in PHP. The client-side logic has been removed entirely; `app.php` now wraps the navigation links in `<div id="pjax-nav-links">`, which the router swaps dynamically on every navigation to guarantee exact replication of the PHP server-rendered active states.

## 2026-07-25 19:15

**Version:** 1.17.1-Alpha+202607251915

### Fixed
- `pjax-router.js` + `app.php`: page heading (`<header id="pjax-header">`) was not being swapped after navigation because it sat outside `#pjax-content`. Added `id="pjax-header"` to the layout element (with an empty hidden placeholder for pages without a heading) and updated the router to swap both `#pjax-header` and `#pjax-content` on every navigation.
- Converted all remaining inline `DOMContentLoaded` wrappers across officer, staff, admin, and shared partials to named functions that also listen to `dts:page-loaded`. Without this, navigating via PJAX to officer/staff pages left all action buttons (release, complete, sign, QR scan) completely unresponsive: `officer/releasing.php` → `initReleasingPage()`, `officer/manage-documents.php` → `initManageDocumentsPage()`, `admin/system-overview.php` → `initSystemOverviewPage()`, `staff/tasks.php` → `initStaffTasksPage()`, `partials/scan-qr-modal.php` → `initScanQrModal()`, `partials/signing-modal.php` → `initSigningModal()`, `general/show-document.php` → `initShowDocumentPage()`.

## 2026-07-25 18:56

**Version:** 1.17.0-Alpha+202607251856

### Fixed
- `AuthMiddleware.php`: added `session_write_close()` immediately after reading auth session data to release the PHP session file lock early, eliminating request head-of-line blocking where a slow `/admin-dashboard` chart API call would prevent a concurrent navigation request from starting.

### Added
- `public/js/pjax-router.js`: new PJAX client-side router implementing instant navigation. Intercepts `<a>` clicks, fetches the target page via `fetch()`, parses it with `DOMParser`, and swaps only `#pjax-content` without a full document reload. Manages a shared `AbortController` (`window.__pjaxController`) that cancels all in-flight chart and polling API calls when the user navigates away. Fires `dts:page-loaded` CustomEvent after every swap as a page lifecycle hook.
- `src/Views/layouts/app.php`: added `#pjax-progress-bar` (3px gradient top bar) for visual navigation feedback, `#pjax-content` wrapper div as the PJAX swap target, and loads `pjax-router.js` last in `<body>`.
- Refactored `admin-dashboard.js`, `statistics.js`, and `system-health.js`: wrapped all init logic in named exported functions (`initAdminDashboard`, `initStatistics`, `initSystemHealth`) listening to both `DOMContentLoaded` and `dts:page-loaded` so charts and event bindings re-initialize correctly after PJAX navigation. All `fetch()` calls now carry `window.__pjaxController.signal` for automatic cancellation on navigation; `AbortError` is silenced in catch handlers.

## 2026-07-25 18:34

**Version:** 1.16.14-Alpha+202607251834

- Added departmental load vs time and database performance metrics calculations in [AdminAnalyticsService.php](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Services/AdminAnalyticsService.php) and [DatabasePerformanceService.php](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Services/DatabasePerformanceService.php).

## 2026-07-23 16:38

**Version:** 1.16.13-Alpha+202607231638

### Fixed
- Standardized document navigation back URL resolution in `DocumentController` (`$_SESSION['doc_return_url']`) and added smart `history.back()` behavior to the "Back to Document" header link in [document-hash-chain.php](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/general/document-hash-chain.php).
- Capped duration calculations in `AdminAnalyticsService::getProcessingHotspotsData` to prevent overflow and negative time intervals.

### Added
- Added "Peak Intake Hours" bar chart telemetry on the Admin Dashboard (`/api/admin-dashboard/peak-intake-hours`) to visualize document submission distribution across 24-hour time slots.
- Integrated one-click copy buttons for cryptographic hashes in [document-hash-chain.php](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/general/document-hash-chain.php) and exception stack traces in [system-overview.php](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Views/admin/system-overview.php).

## 2026-07-23 14:28

**Version:** 1.16.12-Alpha+202607231428

### Fixed
- Refactored [CRYPTOGRAPHIC_LOGS_EXPLAINED.md](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/documentation/CRYPTOGRAPHIC_LOGS_EXPLAINED.md) from dialogue format into a low-level → high-level → key-takeaways explanation; updated the root README documentation blurb to match.

### Added

**Version:** 1.16.11-Alpha+202607231423

### Fixed
- None

### Added
- Added [CRYPTOGRAPHIC_LOGS_EXPLAINED.md](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/documentation/CRYPTOGRAPHIC_LOGS_EXPLAINED.md): IT debate covering hash-chain provenance (birth-certificate analogy), why cryptographic custody is not overengineering, and cryptography vs encryption; linked from root README System Documentation.

## 2026-07-23 09:58

**Version:** 1.16.8-Alpha+202607230958

### Fixed
- Removed redundant subfolder README files (`working-php/README.md` and `backup-laravel/README.md`) to establish the root [README.md](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/README.md) as the single master documentation file for the repository.

## 2026-07-23 09:04

**Version:** 1.16.4-Alpha+202607230904

### Fixed
- Integrated an internal task scheduler loop into `console.php` (`runScheduledTasks`) to run telemetry sampling (`sample-db-metrics.php`), departmental TAT backfill (`backfill-metrics.php`), and metric rollups (`rollup-metrics.php`) automatically inside the console worker loop, eliminating reliance on host `cron` daemons in Distrobox/containerized environments.

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-23 08:54

**Version:** 1.16.3-Alpha+202607230854

### Fixed
- Updated production documentation in `README.md` to specify crontab schedules for metric sampling, departmental TAT backfilling, and metric rollups.

### Added
- Added production database telemetry sampler script `scripts/sample-db-metrics.php` to periodically log active MySQL connection threads (`Threads_connected`), query latency, and slow query counts into `database_metrics`.

## 2026-07-23 08:43

**Version:** 1.16.2-Alpha+202607230843

### Fixed
- Removed all `||`, `??`, and `?:` fallback operators from database connection setups across `seed.js`, `scripts/setup-production-db.js`, `scripts/tune-database.php`, and `src/Config/config.php` to strictly require environment variables supplied by `.env`.

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-23 08:39

**Version:** 1.16.1-Alpha+202607230839

### Fixed
- Fixed `.env` parsing across `seed.js` and `scripts/setup-production-db.js` by explicitly defining the target `.env` file path relative to script directory (`path.join(__dirname, '.env')` / `path.join(__dirname, '../.env')`), preventing `dotenv` from failing when commands are launched from different current working directories.
- Removed all hardcoded database password fallback strings from `seed.js`, `scripts/setup-production-db.js`, and `scripts/tune-database.php` to enforce secure environment variable resolution.
- Refactored `tune-database.php` environment parser to handle unquoted key-value pairs without breaking on special characters.

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-23 08:34

**Version:** 1.16.0-Alpha+202607230834

### Fixed
- Fixed empty Departmental Average TAT, Average TAT by Department, and Department Drill-Down analytics by embedding the `backfill-metrics.php` execution and cache clearing directly into `scripts/fast-seed.php`.
- Corrected non-working day calculation logic in `scripts/fast-seed.php` (`skipNonWorkingDays`) and `seed.js` (`skipWeekend`) to treat Friday as a valid working day instead of skipping it.
- Improved processing time computation in `scripts/backfill-metrics.php` to calculate exact turnaround time (TAT) per step per department directly from `document_logs` timestamp intervals.

### Added
- Added fallback database credentials in `seed.js` to match project configuration defaults.

## 2026-07-23 08:15

**Version:** 1.15.9-Alpha+202607230815

### Fixed
- Filtered out `ready_for_release` documents from the `/tasks` table query (`DocumentQueryService::getPaginatedStaffTasks`) so that finished documents ready for release are only shown in the `/releasing` view rather than appearing in active department task queues where completing them would trigger workflow errors.
- Updated `/tasks` view filter options in `src/Views/staff/tasks.php` to remove the obsolete `ready_for_release` status dropdown selection.

### Added
- Added a `Document Title` column to the "Documents Ready for Release" table in `src/Views/officer/releasing.php`.

## 2026-07-22 17:20

**Version:** 1.15.8-Alpha+202607221720

### Fixed
- Changed default user account email format in `scripts/setup-production-db.js` to clean department usernames (e.g. `admin`, `records.unit`, `cash.unit`).
- Removed strict `email` format validation rule from `AuthController::login` and `UserController::store`/`update` so non-email department usernames (e.g. `cash.unit`) pass backend validation.
- Updated `src/Views/auth/login.php`, `create.php`, and `edit.php` input controls from `type="email"` to `type="text"` and updated label to "Username / Email".
- Updated default credentials reference table in `README.md`.

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-22 16:44

**Version:** 1.15.7-Alpha+202607221644

### Fixed
- Removed unused `storage/database.sqlite` placeholder file.
- Replaced corrupted favicon generator output files with direct PNG favicon reference pointing to `/images/logoipsum-411.png` across layout templates (`login.php`, `app.php`, `guest.php`).

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-22 16:17

**Version:** 1.15.6-Alpha+202607221617

### Fixed
- Verified XLSX report generation in `GenerateReportJob.php` and removed unused `phpoffice/phpspreadsheet` dependency from `composer.json` in favor of high-performance streaming library `openspout/openspout`.

### Added
- None

## 2026-07-22 16:11

**Version:** 1.15.5-Alpha+202607221611

### Fixed
- Reorganized standalone scratch scripts (`test_cache.php`, `test_spout.php`, `test_spout2.php`, `test_spout.xlsx`, `seed_test.js`) by moving them into `working-php/scripts/` and updating autoload requirements.
- Pruned dead commented-out route block (`/tasks` index test alias) in `public/index.php`.

### Added
- Added comprehensive inline documentation across core security and architectural files (`SecurityHelper.php`, `AuthMiddleware.php`, `RoleMiddleware.php`, `DocumentPolicy.php`, `Router.php`) following context-scaled commenting principles.

## 2026-07-22 15:57

**Version:** 1.15.4-Alpha+202607221557

    - Integrated into the desktop and mobile navigation bars for all authenticated users.
    - Added to the Guest Portal (Welcome, Track, Success) and Auth pages (Login, Register) in a fixed top-right position.
    - Seamlessly toggles between Tailwind CSS `dark` mode and Bootstrap 5 `data-bs-theme="dark"`.
    - Persists user preference via `localStorage`, ensuring the selected theme remains active across sessions.
- **Cross-Browser Theme Consistency System:** Implemented a robust theme-detection script in the `<head>` of all layouts (App, Guest, and standalone portal pages). 
    - Automatically detects system/browser dark mode preferences via `prefers-color-scheme`.
    - Ensures the entire project, including the Guest Portal, correctly renders in dark mode when requested by the browser.
- **Bootstrap 5 Dark Mode Integration:** Updated the public-facing portal (Welcome, Track, Success pages) to utilize Bootstrap 5's `data-bs-theme="dark"` attribute, resolving the "white background" issue in dark-preferring browsers.
- **Enabled Guest-Portal Interaction:** Integrated Alpine.js into the public-facing JavaScript bundle (`bootstrap_public.js`), enabling the theme switcher and other interactive components to function correctly on non-authenticated pages.

### FIXED
- **User Management Accessibility:** Improved visibility of the "Edit User" link in the administrative table by adding `dark:text-indigo-400` classes, ensuring it is clearly legible against dark backgrounds.

## [1.8.10-Alpha+202603080830] - 2026-03-08

### FIXED
- **Trust Builder Hashing Precision:** Standardized cryptographic hashing to second-level precision (stripping microseconds) across the `DocumentLog` model, `VerifyIntegrityChain` command, and `RebuildHashChain` command. This eliminates false-positive integrity failures caused by database timestamp rounding.
- **Seeder Timestamp Corruption:** Resolved a critical object reference bug in `DocumentSeeder` where all logs for a single document shared the same final timestamp. This fix restores the accuracy of the historical ledger and fixes the "Zero TAT" issue in dashboard charts.
- **Massive Record Query Exception:** Resolved `QueryException: Prepared statement contains too many placeholders` in the System Health Monitor. Implemented manual pagination and chunked `whereIn` queries to handle integrity reports with 90,000+ records safely.
- **Tailwind 4 Modal Backdrops:** Standardized backdrop syntax and stacking contexts for all system modals (Report Progress, Signing, Decline, and Chart modals), resolving the "white background" overlay issue introduced during the CSS synchronization.

### ADDED
- **Intelligent Simulation Capping:** Updated `DocumentSeeder` to automatically cap data generation at the most recent completed work week (Friday at 5:00 PM).
- **Improved Weekend Data Handling:** Refined seeder logic to move weekend-generated dates back to the preceding Friday instead of forward to Monday, preventing the creation of "future-dated" records relative to the current day.

### CHANGED
- **User Management UX Optimization:** 
    - Moved the "Edit User" link directly under the Name column and removed the redundant "Actions" column to maximize horizontal space.
    - Relocated the "Delete User" functionality into the Edit view for a safer, more centralized workflow.
    - Enabled `break-all` wrapping for the email column and standardized vertical alignment for clipboard copy buttons.

## [1.8.9-Alpha+202603080708] - 2026-03-08

### ADDED
- **Digital Signature Reset Feature:** Implemented an administrative tool to reset a user's digital signature (Ed25519 keys and PIN association). This allows users who have forgotten their Security PIN to re-initialize their cryptographic identity.
    - Added `resetSignature` method to `UserManagementController`.
    - Integrated "Reset Digital Signature" buttons in both the User Edit page and the main User Management list.
    - Added a global signature status indicator (Active vs. Not Set) in the administrative user table.
- **Enhanced Mass Assignment Protection:** Updated the `User` model to include `security_key_set_at` in the `$fillable` array, ensuring consistent state management during signature resets and initializations.

### FIXED
- **DocumentSeeder Performance & Stability:** Completely refactored Stage 2 of the `DocumentSeeder` to utilize database chunking and batch insertions.
    - Resolved a critical `QueryException` where the `documents` table would become temporarily inaccessible or unresponsive during massive sequential updates.
    - Improved seeding speed and memory efficiency by grouping `DocumentLog` and `database_metrics` insertions into chunks of 200 documents.

## [1.8.8-Release+202603072130] - 2026-03-07
