# DepEd Iligan - Document Tracking System (DTS) Prototype

A modern, production-ready web application for digitizing, tracking, and managing official documents for the **DepEd Division of Iligan City**. It features role-based workflow routing, real-time analytics, physical QR code tracking, and a cryptographically secure audit trail powered by SHA-256 hash-chaining and Ed25519 digital signatures.

## ⚡ Architectural Evolution: The Shift to Pure Vanilla PHP

This repository contains two distinct implementations of the system, reflecting a deliberate architectural evolution:

```
DTS Prototype/
├── working-php/     <-- ACTIVE PRODUCTION CODEBASE (Pure Vanilla PHP 8.3)
└── backup-laravel/  <-- HISTORICAL REFERENCE CODEBASE (Original Laravel 12 Build)
```

### Why Port to Pure Vanilla PHP 8.3?

1. **Framework-Free Performance:** Eliminates framework bootstrapping overhead, delivering near-instant page loads and sub-millisecond raw PDO database query execution.
2. **Zero-Dependency Core:** Runs natively using pure PHP 8.3 and MySQL 8.0 without heavy framework runtime dependencies.
3. **Pessimistic Locking & Transaction Safety:** Centralizes database state mutations inside [DocumentWorkflowService.php](working-php/src/Services/DocumentWorkflowService.php) using explicit `PDO` transactions and `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row-level locking to eliminate race conditions under concurrent loads.
4. **Container-Native Scheduling:** Replaced host `cron` daemons with a unified CLI worker ([console.php](working-php/console.php)) featuring an internal task scheduler loop for telemetry sampling, TAT backfilling, metrics rollups, response cache GC, and automated stale pending document garbage collection inside containerized environments (Distrobox / Docker).

## ⚡ Quick Start (`working-php`)

1. **Navigate to the Active Codebase:**
   ```bash
   cd working-php
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies & Build Assets:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set DB_HOST, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
   ```

4. **Initialize & Seed Production Database:**
   ```bash
   composer run seed:prod
   ```

5. **Launch Local Server & Background Worker:**
   ```bash
   # Starts the Web Server, PostCSS Watcher, and Async Queue Worker seamlessly
   composer run dev
   ```

## 🌱 Database Seeding Commands (`working-php/scripts/seeders`)

- **Production Setup (`composer run seed:prod` / `node scripts/seeders/setup-production-db.js`):** Builds database tables from `database.sql` and seeds 14 DepEd departments, baseline document purposes, and initial user accounts.
- **High-Speed Direct Database Seeder (`composer run seed:fast [docs]` / `php scripts/seeders/fast-seed.php`):** Generates up to 50,000+ document logs directly in MySQL in seconds by pre-decrypting Ed25519 keys into RAM.
- **Slow-Speed API Seeder (`composer run seed:dev [docs] [chunk] [concurrency]` / `node scripts/seeders/seed.js`):** Dispatches live HTTP requests against the web server to simulate multi-user traffic and session handling, also functions as a concurrency test.
