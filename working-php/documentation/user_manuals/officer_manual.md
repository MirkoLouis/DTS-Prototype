## 3. First-Time Login & Security Key Setup

All state-mutating actions (Intake, Scan, Finalize, Decline, Release) require an **Ed25519 Digital Signature** to guarantee non-repudiation.

### Step-by-Step Initialization:

1. Navigate to `/login` and sign in with your officer credentials.
2. The system automatically redirects first-time users to `/security-key`.
3. Enter your secret **6-Digit Security PIN**.
4. Click **Set Security Key**. The system generates your cryptographic Ed25519 keypair. Your private key is encrypted with your PIN before being stored safely in the database.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep your 6-digit PIN secret. You will be prompted to enter this PIN every time you intake, scan, decline, or release a document.

## 4. Operational Workflows & Step-by-Step Guide

### 4.1 Intaking & Finalizing New Submissions (`/intake`)

```
[Public/Walk-in Document] ──> [/intake Portal] ──> [Configure Route] ──> [Enter PIN & Sign] ──> [Print QR Tracking Form]
```

1. **Access Intake Portal:** Go to `/intake`. Unprocessed submissions submitted by guests or walk-ins appear in the queue.
2. **Review Document Details:** Click **Manage Route** on a pending document.
3. **Verify Purpose & Requirements:** Inspect submitter details, purpose, and attached compliance items.
4. **Configure Department Route:**
   - Review the default route suggested by the system based on document keywords.
   - Adjust department order (e.g., *Records -> Administrative -> Budget -> Accounting -> ODS*).
5. **Finalize & Sign:**
   - Click **Finalize & Accept Document**.
   - Prompt Modal: Enter your **6-Digit PIN**.
   - The system calculates the initial SHA-256 state hash, generates your Ed25519 signature, and logs `Accepted and Document Routing finalized` in `document_logs`.
6. **Print Tracking Form:** Click **Print Tracking Form** to generate a printable PDF containing the tracking code and scannable QR code (`/documents/{tracking_code}/print-tracking-form`). Attach this form to the physical paper folder.

### 4.2 Scanning & Receiving Physical Documents (`/documents/scan`)

1. Open the QR Scanner modal from the top navigation bar or navigate to `/intake`.
2. Point the camera scanner at the document's printed QR code (or enter the tracking code manually).
3. Confirm document details in the pop-up modal.
4. Enter your **Security PIN** and click **Receive Document**.
5. The system locks the database row (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), records a `Received at Records` log entry with your digital signature, and updates the document status.

### 4.3 Declining Incomplete Submissions

1. On the document management page (`/documents/{id}/manage`), click **Decline Document**.
2. Select a decline reason or type explicit notes in the remarks box (e.g., *Missing Principal endorsement signature*).
3. Enter your **Security PIN** and confirm.
4. The system updates status to `declined` and logs the signed decline record.

### 4.4 Releasing Completed Documents (`/releasing`)

When a document finishes all departmental routing steps, its status advances to `ready_for_release` and it appears in the Releasing Portal.

1. Navigate to **Releasing** (`/releasing`).
2. Locate the physical document folder returned by the final department.
3. Click **Release Document**.
4. In the releasing modal:
   - Record the name and contact of the person receiving the physical document.
   - Add optional release notes.
   - Enter your **Security PIN**.
5. Click **Confirm Release**. The document status updates to `completed` / `released`, and a final signed log entry is generated.

### 4.5 Exporting Statistical Reports (`/statistics`)

1. Navigate to `/statistics`.
2. Select desired date ranges and report formats (PDF or Excel).
3. Click **Generate Report**. The system dispatches an asynchronous background job ([GenerateReportJob](file:///home/mirkolouis/Documents/DTS%20Prototype/working-php/src/Jobs/GenerateReportJob.php)).
4. Monitor export progress in the floating report progress modal and download the completed file.

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **Q: The QR camera scanner is not opening.**  
  *A:* Ensure your web browser has camera permissions granted for the DTS domain. Alternatively, type the tracking code into the manual input box.
- **Q: An error says "Action Denied: Document failed integrity check".**  
  *A:* The document's SHA-256 state hash does not match the ledger. The document has been auto-frozen by the Active Guard. Notify a System Administrator to run Auto-Resolve.
